# Paperfrogs

A quiet place for thoughtful tools, gentle code, and latent ideas.  
Not a company. Not a startup. Just a home for small, slow, meaningful work.

## Philosophy

We build not for scale, but for clarity.  
Not for noise, but for stillness.  
Tools that feel like they were left on your desk by someone who cares.

---

## Status

Phase: Early development  
Stability: Expect changes, experiments, and occasional whimsy  
Production use: Not yet - we'll let our users to explore it when it gets ready  
Contributions: Gentle, intentional, and always appreciated

## What Lives Here

Explorations:

- **paperfrogs/dev** — core tooling, CLI utilities, and development workflows  
- **paperfrogs/ai** — experimental models, prompt libraries, and lightweight agents  
- **paperfrogs/design** — themes, UI components, and visual systems for indie tools  
- **paperfrogs/labs** — incubator for wild ideas (no roadmap, no deadlines)

All repositories are minimal, well-documented, and designed to be forked, not merely installed.
